### Why write this script
As we all know, Freenom is the only merchant on the planet that provides free top-level domain names, but it needs to be renewed every year for up to one year at a time. Since I applied for a bunch of domain names, and not at the same time,
So I felt frustrated every time I renewed, so I wrote this automatic renewal script.

### Demo
![Email example](https://s2.ax1x.com/2020/01/31/139Rrd.png "Email content")

Regardless of the success or failure of the renewal or the execution of the script, you will receive emails from the program. In the case of a renewal success or failure email, the email will include the number of days that the domain name has not been renewed.

### Preparation
- Email of robot: Used to send notification emails.
- Your email: Used to receive notification emails sent by robots.
- VPS: Any server can be used. The system recommends `Centos7`, and the PHP version must be` php7.1` or above.
- No more

### Setting up Gmail
***
1.In `Settings > Forwarding and POP/IMAP`, tick
- Enable POP for all messages
- Enable IMAP

![gmail Configuration 01](https://s2.ax1x.com/2020/02/01/1GDsMR.png "gmail Configuration 01")

Then save your changes.

2.Allow less secure applications

After logging into Google Mail, visit [this page](https://myaccount.google.com/u/0/lesssecureapps?pli=1&pageId=none) and enable the application that is not secure enough.

Also, if prompted
> Do not allow access to account

After logging in to Google Mail, go to [this page](https://accounts.google.com/b/0/DisplayUnlockCaptcha) and click Allow. This situation is relatively rare.

### Telegram bot
***
If you don't want to use email push, you can also use Telegram bot. In the `config.php` file, 
replace the Change the `enable` value to `true` to enable the Telegram bot. Similarly, 
change the value of `enable` under` mail` to `false` to disable the email push method. Telegram bot corresponds to two configuration values, 
one is `chatID`, you can get your own id by sending `/start` to `@userinfobot` using your Telegram account, 
and the other is `token`, your Telegram bot token, how to obtain a token and how to create a Telegram bot, 
please refer to the official document: [click me to know](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather)

*This completes the settings related to notifications, followed by the configuration related to this program* :)

### Configuration script
All operations are performed under Centos7 system, other Linux distributions are similar
#### Get the source code
```bash
$ mkdir -p /data/wwwroot/freenom
$ cd /data/wwwroot/freenom

# clone the repository source
$ git clone https://github.com/luolongfei/freenom.git ./
```

#### Configuration process
```bash
# Copy configuration file template
$ cp .env.example .env

# Edit configuration file
$ vim .env

# .env Each item in the file has a detailed description, which will not be repeated here. In short, you need to change all the items in it to your own. Note the format of the multi-account configuration:
# e.g. MULTIPLE_ACCOUNTS='<account1>@<password1>|<account2>@<password2>|<account3>@<password3>'
# Of course, if you only have a single account, you only need to configure FREEENOM_USERNAME and FREEENOM_PASSWORD. The configurations of single account and multiple accounts will be read together and duplicated.

# After editing, press "Esc" to return to the command mode, enter ":wq" and press Enter to save and exit. If you don't use vim editor, you can ask Uncle Google. :)
```

#### Add scheduled task
#### Install crontabs and cronie
```bash
$ yum -y install cronie crontabs

# Verify if crond is installed and started
$ yum list cronie && systemctl status crond

# Verify that crontab is installed
$ yum list crontabs $$ which crontab && crontab -l
```

##### Open the task form and edit
```bash
$ crontab -e

# Task content is as follows
# The meaning of this task is to execute the run file under /data/wwwroot/freenom/ at 9 AM every day
# Note: In some cases, crontab may not find your php path. The following command will output an error message in the freenom_crontab.log file. You should specify the php path: replace the following php with /usr/local/php/bin/php (based on the actual situation)
00 09 * * * cd /data/wwwroot/freenom/ && php run > freenom_crontab.log 2>&1
```

##### Restart the crond daemon (This step is required each time you edit the task form for the task to take effect)
```bash
$ systemctl restart crond
```
To check if the `Task` is normal, you can set the execution time of the above task to a few minutes, and then wait until the task execution is completed,
check the contents of the `freenom_crontab.log` file in the `/data/wwwroot/freenom/` directory for errors. Common error messages are as follows:
- /bin/sh: php: command not found
- /bin/sh: /usr/local/php: Is a directory

> solution:

> # Determine the location of php, the general output is "php: /usr/local/php /usr/local/php/bin/php", we choose: /usr/local/php/bin/php

> Now we know that php's path is `/usr/local/php/bin/php` (may be different according to the actual situation of your own system),

Of course, if your `crontab` can correctly find the `php path` without error, you don't need to do anything.

*So far, all the configurations have been completed, let's verify if the whole process works* :)

#### Verification
You can first change the value of `noticeFreq` in` config.php` to 1 (that is, send an email notification each time), and then execute
```bash
$ cd /data/wwwroot/freenom/ && php run
```
If nothing else, you will receive an email about the domain name.
